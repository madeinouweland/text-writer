## Why another text editor?

Are you searching for a real pen & paper alternative?
Would you like to be able to write whatever is in your head **RIGHT NOW**?

Sometimes it feel that apps that claim to be productivity tools, are exactly **not** that. At crucial moments (like starting or closing the app) they bother you with questions like:

- Would you like to see our 7 new unimportant features that no-one really asked for?
- Would you like to save your data? (Yes, please)
- Do you like our app?

And all this goodness is preferrably presented to you in the form of a modal dialog.

**BOOM!** There goes the productivity!

## So my promise to you:

- An online HTML/Javascript editor that works cross browser, cross platform
- Connects to your dropbox. Your data is **your data**. You can find it on your hard drive.
- No modal dialogs. Not now. Not ever.
- Free to use, source available for you to see (or fork) here at github.
- Works a bit like a journal. Everything you write during the 4th of july in 2018 will be **automatically** saved in a text file called 2018-07-04.txt

## Sounds good?
